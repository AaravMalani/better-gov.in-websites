# Better `gov.in` Websites
Just some `.gov.in` websites but better to prove that it's not tough!

## Why am I making this?
Making a website is not at all tough in 2023. 

Building a full-stack application is the tough part, so making a front end static page nowdays is a piece of cake.

The Indian Government websites are built with HTML4 and JQuery (some websites use vulnerable JQuery versions), are outdated and scored around 60 with Lighthouse (a couple of websites I tested including the [Indian Railways website ↗️](https://indianrailways.gov.in/) has an accessibility widget (good) but scored 60/100 on accessibility (bad)). 
They use ancient 90's `<marquee>`s and flashy animations that just... belong to the previous millenium. 

If a 15 year old can do it, then so can the NIC. This isn't to insult the NIC, more to call for change and to take Indian websites to the 21st century.
